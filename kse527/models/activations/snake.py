    Implementation of the serpentine-like sine-based periodic activation function
    
    .. math::
         Snake_a := beta x + \frac{1}{a} sin^2(ax) = x - \frac{1}{2a}cos{2ax} + \frac{1}{2a}
    
    References:
        - This activation function is from this paper by Liu Ziyin, Tilman Hartwig, Masahito Ueda:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195
        - We implement the slope parameter inspired by this:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01579
        Be careful though: although the authors claim its monotonicity, it does not seem so.
        
    Examples:
        >>> a1 = snake(256)
        >>> x = torch.randn(256)
        >>> x = a1(x)

        Initialization.
        Args:
            in_features: shape of the input
            a: trainable parameter
            beta: slope parameter. Defaults to 1, 0.5 may be better according to https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01579. Not learnable for now
            trainable: sets `a` as a trainable parameter
            
            `a` is initialized to 1 by default, higher values = higher-frequency, 
            5-50 is a good starting point if you already think your data is periodic, 
            consider starting lower e.g. 0.5 if you think not, but don't worry, 
            `a` will be trained along with the rest of your model.
